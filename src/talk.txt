To Cache..

first populate the cache on installing the worker


self.addEventListener('install', function (event) {
    event.waitUntil(preCacheFunc()) 
})

First let's setup an install listener to preCache right when the SW is installed

var CACHE_VERSION = 'name-of-my-cache';
var CACHE_FILES = [
    '/whatever-i-want-to-precache.jpg',
    '/more-precache.html',
    'http://localhost:8080/src/images/xmaskitty.jpg'
];
var preCacheFunc = function(){
    return caches.open(CACHE_VERSION)
        .then(function (cache) {
            return cache.addAll(CACHE_FILES);
        })
}

pre cache all the files that we specify by some CACHE_FILES

self.addEventListener('fetch', function (event) {
    event.respondWith(grabFromCacheOrAdd(event.request))
});

now we'll set an event listener for any fetch on the scope of this SW.

function grabFromCacheOrAdd(req) {
    return caches.open(CACHE_VERSION).then(function (cache) {
        return cache.match(req).then(function (matching) {
            if (matching) {
                return matching
            } else {
                return cache.add(req)
            }
        });
    });
}
Now, we will try to get the request from cache, if it's not there we will add ALL requests to
that cache specified by CACHE_VERSION regardless if it was in preCache files or not

Keep in mind this is a totally bungues example. Caching EVERYTHING static and
dynamic on your site is crazy and should probably only happen in special cases
when your site is actually down, but jsut work with me here for illustrative purposes

You can do othr cool things

CORS

Ever been really annoyed of developing with CORS errors ?

```
Failed to load http://missv.info/external: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://local.missv.info:8080' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

 Service workers provide a hacky work around for 
dealing with CORS. One could communicate with whatever external host they want by running a service worker
that pretends to be that external host but on the host actually rnnning

Ok, that sounded confusing so let's see what that would actually look like

You want to run:

```
fetch('https://www.google.com')
fetch('http://some-other-host-aint-me.com')
```

In service worker

```
const myExtralsURI = '/external/'
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
    const strippedURI = request.url.toString().split(myExtralsURI)
    const externalURL = 'http://' + strippedURI[1]
    return await fetch(externalURL)
}

```
